# 0x08. C - Recursion

## Project Overview

The "0x08. C - Recursion" project is a key part of the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum, designed to deepen your understanding of recursion in C programming. By tackling various tasks, you'll learn not only what recursion is, but also how to implement it effectively. This project includes both mandatory and advanced challenges, and it's an opportunity to demonstrate your skills in creating recursive functions. Each task reinforces your ability to craft solutions without relying on standard library functions, with the exception of `_putchar`.

## Requirements and Tasks

This project mandates the use of specific editors (e.g., `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`) and requires code compilation on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` using `gcc` with strict flags. The project guidelines emphasize code quality with newline endings, adherence to the Betty coding style, and limits on function count in each file. Global variables and standard library functions, except for `_putchar`, are not permitted. Additionally, your code should not use loops or static variables.

The project consists of several tasks, each of which is designed to build your understanding of recursion and its applications. From printing strings in reverse to calculating factorials and checking for prime numbers, you'll explore a range of scenarios in which recursion is both applicable and essential. The advanced tasks push your skills further, including determining palindrome strings and comparing complex string patterns. Throughout the project, you'll gain valuable experience in both basic and advanced recursive programming, preparing you for more complex coding challenges.
