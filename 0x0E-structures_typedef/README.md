In this project, we delve into the fascinating world of structures and typedef in the C programming language. Structures provide a way to group related data under a single user-defined data type, making it more organized and intuitive to work with complex data. By defining and initializing structures, we create a foundation for modeling real-world entities and handling their attributes effectively.

Additionally, this project explores the power of the `typedef` keyword, which simplifies complex data types by creating aliases for them. This not only enhances code readability but also boosts code maintainability. By employing `typedef`, we can give meaningful names to data types, making the code more self-explanatory. Overall, this project serves as an excellent opportunity to deepen your understanding of data structures and user-defined data types in C, enabling you to write more organized, efficient, and maintainable code.
