0x13. C - More Singly Linked Lists
Project Overview
Hello, fellow developers! ðŸ‘‹ In this project, I delve deeper into the world of singly linked lists, building on the concepts covered in the previous project. The main focus is on mastering the manipulation and utilization of linked lists, an essential data structure in computer science.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, I aim to achieve the following learning objectives:

Understand and apply the use of linked lists in C.
Develop the ability to find and use relevant information independently.
Enhance problem-solving skills related to algorithmic challenges.
Resources
To successfully complete this project, I plan to make use of the following resources:

Google for research and information gathering.
YouTube for video tutorials and additional explanations.
Requirements
Editors: I will be using vi, vim, or emacs for coding.
Compilation: All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with specific options.
Coding Style: I will adhere to the Betty style for code consistency.
Functions: Each file should contain no more than 5 functions.
Header File: I will create a header file named lists.h containing prototypes for functions.
Standard Library: Only allowed to use malloc, free, and exit. Other standard library functions are restricted.
Global Variables: Not allowed.
