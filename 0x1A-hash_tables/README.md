# 0x1A. C - Hash Tables

This project, guided by Julien Barbier, dives deep into the fundamentals of hash tables in C programming. It's a challenging and engaging project focusing on algorithms and data structures, specifically tailored for learners looking to understand the intricacies of hash tables. This is an ongoing second chance project that started on February 1, 2024, at 6:00 AM and will conclude by February 8, 2024, at 6:00 AM. An auto-review will be launched at the deadline to evaluate the submissions.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to articulate:

### General
- The concept and utility of a hash function.
- Characteristics of a good hash function.
- Understanding of what hash tables are, their mechanics, and how to utilize them effectively.
- Knowledge about collision in hash tables and the principal strategies to address collisions.
- The advantages and potential drawbacks of employing hash tables.
- The most prevalent scenarios where hash tables are applied.

## Project Tasks
This project comprises several tasks focusing on different aspects of hash tables, including but not limited to creating and using hash tables, implementing hash functions, dealing with collisions, and exploring real-world applications. Both mandatory and optional tasks are designed to enhance your learning experience and solidify your understanding of hash tables.

### Mandatory
All tasks listed under this section are required for a passing grade.

### Optional
Tasks in this category aim to further expand your knowledge and are recommended for those seeking to go above and beyond the project requirements.

## Contribution Guidelines
This project is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your understanding of hash tables in C. Ensure your code adheres to the coding standards set by Julien Barbier and is thoroughly tested. Collaborate with peers for a richer learning experience but ensure to maintain academic honesty.

## Submission
- Deadline: February 8, 2024, at 6:00 AM.
- All tasks should be pushed to your GitHub repository, followed by an auto-review submission.

Good luck, and may your hash functions be efficient and your collisions minimal!
