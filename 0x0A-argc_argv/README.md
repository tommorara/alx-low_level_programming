# Project: 0x0A. C - argc, argv

## Author: Julien Barbier

## Project Overview
This is an ongoing second chance project that started on October 27, 2023, and must be completed by November 2, 2023. An auto review will be launched at the deadline to evaluate the progress.

## Project Status
- Auto QA review: 0.0/37 mandatory & 0.0/9 optional
- Total Completion: 0.0%
- Mandatory Completion: 0.0%
- Optional Completion: 0.0%
- Calculation: 0.0% + (0.0% * 0.0%) == 0.0%

## Resources
To successfully complete this project, you should read or watch the following resources:
- [Arguments to main](#)
- [argc and argv](#)
- [What does argc and argv mean?](#)
- [How to compile with unused variables](#)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain to anyone, without using Google:
- How to use arguments passed to your program
- The two prototypes of `main` that you know of, and in which case you should use one or the other
- How to use `__attribute__((unused))` or `(void)` to compile functions with unused variables or parameters

## Copyright and Plagiarism
As a student, you are responsible for coming up with solutions to the project's tasks yourself. Copying and pasting someone else's work or publishing project content is strictly forbidden and may result in removal from the program.

## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, with the options: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, located at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- Your code should follow the Betty style, and it will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`
- Don't forget to push your header file
- You are allowed to use the standard library for this project
