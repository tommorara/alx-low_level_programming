# Function Pointers in C

This project focuses on understanding and utilizing function pointers in the C programming language. Function pointers are a versatile and powerful concept in C, allowing developers to write more flexible and dynamic code. In this project, you will learn what function pointers are, how to use them effectively, and gain a deeper insight into where they point within the virtual memory. By mastering this essential concept, you will be better equipped to create adaptable and efficient C programs.

## Project Overview

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will:

- Have a clear understanding of function pointers and how to employ them in your code.
- Gain insights into the inner workings of function pointers and their role in the virtual memory.

### Project Requirements

- You are allowed to use vi, vim, or emacs as your code editor.
- All your code will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with specific compiler flags.
- Your code should follow the Betty style, with checks performed using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- Global variables should be avoided, and each file should contain no more than five functions.
- The project only permits the use of specific C standard library functions, including `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`. `_putchar` can be used for output purposes. The `_putchar.c` file should not be pushed as the project provides its own.
- The project requires the inclusion of function prototypes in the header file `function_pointers.h`, which should be include-guarded.

By completing these tasks, you will gain a deep understanding of function pointers in C, enabling you to build more robust and adaptable programs that utilize this fundamental concept effectively.
