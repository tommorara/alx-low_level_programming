# 0x0B. C - malloc, free

**Project Overview**
This project focuses on dynamic memory allocation in C using `malloc` and `free`. It began on October 30, 2023, at 6:00 AM, and must be completed by November 1, 2023, at 6:00 AM.

**Learning Objectives**
By the end of this project, you should understand:
- Dynamic memory allocation with `malloc` and `free`
- How to prevent memory leaks using Valgrind

**Requirements**
- You are allowed to use `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs` as editors.
- Your code will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`.
- The project requires you to create functions that use `malloc` and `free`.
- Use a header file called `main.h` for function prototypes.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- Follow the Betty style guidelines.

Good luck with your project!
