# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

## Description

This project focuses on the implementation and understanding of different search algorithms in C. Through this project, you will explore various search techniques and understand their space complexity, helping you determine the best search algorithm to use depending on specific needs.

## Project Details

- **Weight:** 1
- **Start Date:** May 6, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **End Date:** May 9, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release:** May 7, 2024, 12:00 AM
- **Auto Review Deadline:** May 9, 2024, 6:00 AM

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain, without the help of Google:

- What a search algorithm is
- The implementation and use of linear search
- The implementation and use of binary search
- How to choose the best search algorithm based on different scenarios

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- Code should adhere to the Betty style
- No global variables allowed
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The only allowed standard library function is `printf`
- Main.c files are for testing but should not be pushed to your repo
- All function prototypes should be included in a header file called `search_algos.h`
- All header files must have include guards

### More Info

You will need to write files containing Big O notations. Please use the following format:

- O(1)
- O(n)
- O(n!)
- n*m -> O(nm)
- n square -> O(n^2)
- sqrt n -> O(sqrt(n))
- log(n) -> O(log(n))
- n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))

## Plagiarism Policy

- You must come up with solutions independently to meet the learning objectives.
- Plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
- Do not publish any content from this project.
