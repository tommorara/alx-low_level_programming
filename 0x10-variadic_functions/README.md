Variadic Functions in C
This project delves into variadic functions, a powerful feature in C that allows functions to accept a variable number of arguments. By the end of this project, you will grasp the intricacies of variadic functions and be adept at using macros like va_start, va_arg, and va_end. Additionally, you will explore the role and significance of the const type qualifier in C programming.

Project Overview
Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this project, you will:

Understand the concept of variadic functions and their practical applications.
Gain proficiency in using va_start, va_arg, and va_end macros to process variable arguments.
Learn the significance of the const type qualifier in enhancing code quality.
Project Requirements
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
Compilation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with specific compiler flags.
Adherence to the Betty style, ensuring code readability and consistency.
Restriction on global variables and a limit of five functions per file.
Use of specific C standard library functions, macros (va_start, va_arg, and va_end), and _putchar.
Inclusion of function prototypes in the header file variadic_functions.h with proper include guards.
By addressing the tasks outlined in the project, you will solidify your understanding of variadic functions and hone your C programming skills, enabling you to write more flexible and dynamic code.
